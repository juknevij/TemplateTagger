Version 1.0.3(January 3, 2013)
Fixed bug in the computation of planar flow
Added example6.cc to show how to set up a TopTemplateTagger in Fastjet
Added example7.cc to show how to to set up a TopTemplateTagger in Fastjet and how to select templates pT based on jet pT.

Version 1.0.2(December 20, 2012)
A TemplateTagger can be set up using a TemplateDefinition
Added example5.cc,  shows how to select template pT based on jet pT

Version 1.0.1 (December 18, 2012)
Added a faster, simpler implementation of overlap function using just cones.
Optionally, we provide generalized implementations that make use of custom functional measures, i.e. Gaussian, cones, etc..
Added optimization based on ATLAS local code

Version 1.0.0 (December 12, 2012)
